JOBREACKER

OVERVIEW
This project aims to streamline the job search process through collecting user input on job application information and organizing them in a way that is efficient, clear, and easily manageable. We will provide a centralized, structured, and intuitive solution for job seekers to efficiently track their applications, stay organized with deadlines, and gain insights from shared experiences. Additionally, we want to create a community for job seekers and improve the transparency in the job application process. 
There are four main pages for our site: 1. Sign-up/Login Page; 2. User Profile Page; 3.Job Tracker Page; 4. Company Review Page.

DIRECTIONS OF USE
Sign-up/Login Page
1. Login 
    - Checks for username and password credentials. If matches, login to profile page; otherwise, flash the user for specific errors (e.g. username and password mismatch, incorrect password format, username does not exist).
2. Signup
    - Helps the user create an account. The user needs to enter different fields, with some required and some optional as hinted on the page. The user also needs to choose a username that is not taken as well as a password that satisfies the password rules on the page (otherwise, the page will flash the user for specific errors). If the user enters these fields, the site creates an account for the user and takes the user to the profile page.

User Profile Page
1. Display User Profile
    - The page displays user profile that the user has entered. The optional fields that the user didn't fill out are left empty.
2. Update Profile
    - By clicking the update profile button, the site takes the user to a update profile page, where the user could edit every field on his profile except username and password. 
    - By clicking the update button, the site updates the user's profile and takes the user to the main profile page with the udpated information.
    - By clicking the cancel button, the site does not update the user's profile and takes the user back to the main profile page.
